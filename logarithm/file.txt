Logarithm: the inverse of exponentiation

Logarithms and exponents are a pair

The logarithm of a number roughly measures the number of times you can divide that number by 2 before you get a value that's less than or equal to 1.

O(log n) time complexity is great!

O(nlog n) time complexity is bad but better than O(n^2)!
